# This is my DnD Character creator

### Summary
I managed to teach myself Python fundamentals during the week break in between my sets of EFA Courses. 
My decision to do this project came after skimming through a couple chapters from https://github.com/jmsolomon64/PythonDnD.git
I found this to be a really fun experience and learned the similarities between c# and Python.
Importing modules is just like invoking namespaces, and it seems that most scripting languages have very 
similar fundamental logic its just the structure of the code that's different. For example Python strictly reads code top to bottom
where as c# and JS will hoist different things for you (that was a tough lesson...)
